## What is Dia Whiteboard?

Dia Whiteboard is a collaborative, AI-powered study and productivity board that brings all your work into a single interactive space. Users can attach PDFs, images, audio files, drawings, notes, and even embed mini browser windows—eliminating the need to juggle between multiple apps.

Dia uses an advanced RAG-based retrieval system to enable fast and accurate content discovery across all attached files. With Qwen3-VL powering OCR and visual understanding, users can search through handwritten notes, scanned documents, diagrams, and images as naturally as searching text.
